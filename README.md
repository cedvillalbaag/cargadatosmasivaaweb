# Data Loading Automation: Excel to Web Form with Selenium and Python

#Automation #Excel #Selenium   
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to automate loading data from an Excel file to a web form using the Selenium library.

This is a practical solution for repetitive data entry tasks, ideal for scenarios where large volumes of structured information need to be transferred to web interfaces.

### About this Project:
The main objective of this script is:

- Read data from an Excel file (.xlsx): Use the openpyxl library (or pandas if you prefer) to extract information row by row or column by column.
- Automate browser interaction: Use Selenium WebDriver to open a web page, locate form elements (text fields, buttons, selectors, etc.), and simulate user input.
- Dynamically populate web forms: Iterate over Excel data and populate web page form fields with the corresponding information.
- Wait handling: Incorporate explicit or implicit waits to ensure that web page elements are loaded and ready for interaction.
